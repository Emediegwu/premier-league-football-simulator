# premier-league-football-simulator
#This project simulates the footballing league format in the English Premier League, including all matches printed out in the console.
#Please feel free to edit and make changes in the files.

There are two files named epl.py and laliga2.py. Both do the same basic job of simulating football matches in England's top league, and printing out the results of the matches in the console, and then a tkinter window shows the final league standings.

In epl.py, the tkinter window only shows the teams and their final points in the league. The matches are also printed in the console, but the epl.py is contains a much-more simpler code and easy-to-understand than the laliga2.py file.

The laliga2.py also simulates matches in England's top league, never mind the file name (you can simply edit the team names and their strengths to simulate other leagues, such as La Liga in Spain). But the tkinter window in this second file displays a real-looking league table, with all statistics duly shown (games played, goals for, goal difference, etc). Also, this file tries to use a more sophisticated method to simulate match results (Poisson distribution). In all, both files were just made by me for fun.

You can tweak and twist it as much as you like! I made these files as a learner's project as I'm still a beginner, so I would welcome suggestions, ideas and changes. Also, don't feel so irritated if the codes don't work as you would expect. It's why it's on Github (*winks*) so corrections are highly welcome.

Have fun, football fan!
